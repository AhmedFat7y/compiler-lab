{First Template}
{March 2016}


{Item List}
In this template you have an itemized list that you have to generate the tokens for using the lexical analyzer implemented in this milestone. 
 newline 
item 1
item 2
item 3
  --->  item parse error null
{Math Mode}
In this section you have the math mode of latex presented using the dollar sign. In this mode you can present any form of mathematical expression. However, for the scope of the the project we only restricted it to numbers, variables(might be character, or a character followed by a number as shown below), operators(+,-,*,/,=) and functions. 
 newline 
5  --->  mathmode_content parse error null
 newline 
3x  --->  mathmode_content parse error null
 newline 
5  --->  mathmode_content parse error null
 newline 
f_1  --->  mathmode_content parse error null
{New Line}
The new Line in latex in expressed using double backslash, which will be also be the case in the project as well. So you might need to change your previous lexer a bit to adapt to this.  --->  content parse error null
